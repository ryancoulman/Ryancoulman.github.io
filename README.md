### Classic Snake Game - <small>Python/small>

**Overview**

Experience the classic Snake arcade game using Python's `turtle` module. This game allows you to relive the nostalgia of the arcade with a simple yet engaging implementation. The game records and stores your high score in a text file, updating it whenever you achieve a new high score. Control the snake using the keyboard arrows and try to beat your own high score!

**Features**

- *Classic Gameplay:* Navigate the snake to eat the food, which makes it grow longer.
- *High Score Tracking:* The game records your high score in a `highscore.txt` file and updates it if you achieve a new high score.
- *Keyboard Controls:* Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- *Continuous Movement:* The snake moves continuously, adding to the challenge.
