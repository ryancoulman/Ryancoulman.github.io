### Modelling a d-dimensional random walk on a infinite cartesian grid - <small>C</small>

**Random Walk Simulation**

This project implements a random walk simulation in multiple cartesian dimensions using C. The code demonstrates proficiency in several fundamental programming concepts, including dynamic memory allocation, use of structs, file I/O, and modular code organization.
This project was part of my final year module 'Programming' and received a mark of 88%. Please see `code_report.pdf` to see extensive testing of the programs capabilities and an explanation of the approach involved.   

**Features**

- **Multi-Dimensional Random Walk:** Simulates random walks in configurable dimensions and grid sizes.
- **High-Performance Computation:** Efficiently handles large-scale simulations using dynamically allocated memory.
- **Data Output:** Outputs the results of simulations to CSV files for further analysis.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Utilises `malloc`, `realloc` and `free` to manage memory for simulation structures.
- **Pointers:** Accesses and amends main() defined variables within functions using pointers.
- **Structs:** Defines and manipulates complex data structures to represent the state of the random walk.
- **File I/O:** Writes simulation results to CSV files for visualization and analysis.
- **Random Number Generation:** Uses random functions to simulate the movement of particles in the grid.

### Classic Snake Game - <small>Python</small>

**Overview**

Experience the classic Snake arcade game using Python's `turtle` module. This game allows you to relive the nostalgia of the arcade with a simple yet engaging implementation. The game records and stores your high score in a text file, updating it whenever you achieve a new high score. Control the snake using the keyboard arrows and try to beat your own high score!

**Features**

- *Classic Gameplay:* Navigate the snake to eat the food, which makes it grow longer.
- *High Score Tracking:* The game records your high score in a `highscore.txt` file and updates it if you achieve a new high score.
- *Keyboard Controls:* Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- *Continuous Movement:* The snake moves continuously, adding to the challenge.
